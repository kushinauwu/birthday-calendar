# Interactive Naruto Birthday Calendar

A calendar of my favourite Naruto characters' birthdays, made using Bootstrap and Javascript. 

I used the carousel in the Bootstrap 4.3 framework. The javascript is to make the character photos visible by hovering over the date. Birthdays are marked a different color than the other days, and on hovering change colors. The blurred character photos can also be hovered to reveal the poictures and highlight the birthdate.
