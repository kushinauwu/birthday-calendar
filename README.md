# Interactive Naruto Birthday Calendar

A calendar of my favourite Naruto characters' birthdays, made using Bootstrap and Javascript! 

I used the carousel in the Bootstrap 4.3 framework. The javascript is to make the character photos visible by hovering over the date. Birthdays are marked a different color than the other days, and on hovering over, change colors and reveal the character whose birthday it is. The blurred character photos can also be hovered to reveal the pictures and highlight the birthdate.
